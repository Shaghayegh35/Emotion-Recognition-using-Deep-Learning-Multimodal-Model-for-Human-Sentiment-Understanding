# Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning-Multimodal-Model-for-Human-Sentiment-Understanding
This project implements a deep learning–based emotion recognition system that identifies human facial emotions from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
It leverages Keras/TensorFlow models trained on facial expression datasets to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.
The system provides a modular structure for integrating trained models (.h5 files) and can be deployed via FastAPI or run locally for inference and visualization.
